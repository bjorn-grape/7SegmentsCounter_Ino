## 4 digits 7 segments counter

reference is: HS420561K-32

Simple project I did with a friend on arduino.
This code only provides you an example of display.
You'll have to define the pins used in Digit's header.

This code is not optimized at some points but it does work.
Feel free to send me an e-mail if you have any advise.
